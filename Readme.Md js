creating a function = defining a function.
Running a function = calling a function e.g; addTodo(todoTitle,priority) {

}
Passing in a value to a function, they can be a number or a string(they are also called ARGUMENTS).


function saveTodo() {

const saveTodos JSON.parse(localStorage.getItems('todos'));
